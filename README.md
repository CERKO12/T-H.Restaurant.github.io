### Project Objective
Our solution will integrate a vibrant front-end interface with a robust back-end database, offering users and restaurants the most streamlined method for making and managing dine-in reservations.

### Features
1) Product Listing: The website will feature a comprehensive product listing through a user-friendly menu. This listing will provide visitors with an organized view of all the available products or services, categorized appropriately for ease of browsing
2) Reservation: Our website will incorporate a seamless reservation system. This feature will allow customers to book or reserve specific products, services, or times lots directly from the website.
3) Location: To guide our customers efficiently, the website will have a dedicated location section. This feature will provide the physical address of the business, supplemented by an interactive map.
4) Shop: Beyond just showcasing products or services, our website will also host an e-commerce shop feature. Here, customers can purchase gift cards and exclusive gifts directly.
5) Customer Relationship Management: Within the CRM or the profile management system, there would be specific fields or sections dedicated to capturing and storing individual details about customers, including but not limited to their birthdays, food allergies, preferences, and other pertinent information.
